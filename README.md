# ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS PROJECT IS LOOKING FOR A MAINTAINER ‚ö†Ô∏è

I no longer posess means to test this component on newer Home Assistant versions as I have re-flashed the only Hekr device I had, and the other blew up spectacularly.

Unless someone wants to lease a constant VPN with a connection to a device, I (@alryaz) will be unable to support this project further.

Please, raise an issue to ask for maintainersihp transfer.

  </ol>
</details>

### Installation from Archive

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning!** This option is **<ins>not recommended</ins>** due to
> the difficulty of keeping the installed integration up to date.

1. Download the [archive with the latest version of the integration](https://github.com/alryaz/hass-hekr-component/releases/latest/download/hekr.zip)
2. Create the folder `custom_components` inside your Home Assistant configuration folder (if it doesn't exist)
3. Create the folder `hekr` inside the `custom_components` folder
4. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive into the `hekr` folder
5. Restart the _Home Assistant_ server

## Supported protocols

- [Power meter protocol](#power_meter_protocol): `power_meter`
- [Power socket protocol](#power_socket_protocol): `power_socket`

## Power meter protocol: `power_meter`

_(more screenshots available at: [images/power_meter](images/power_meter))_

### Supported devices
- HIKING DDS238-4W

### Example configuration
```yaml
hekr:
  devices:
    - host: home-power-meter.lan
      device_id: ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF
      control_key: 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70
      protocol: power_meter
      sensors:
        - general
        - detailed
      switches: main_power
```

In this state, the plugin will generate three sensors, all obtained via a single `queryDev` command.
These sensors are:
- `status` - **Status** (whether device reports any kind of errors)
- `current_consumption` - **Current Consumption** (current power consumption in *W*, phase attributes in *kW*)
- `total_consumption` - **Total Consumption** (total energy consumption in *kW/h*).

Also the following sensors are available, but not enabled by default (as they increase the amount of requests required
to poll the device, leading to infrequent, but possible timeouts):
- `general` - **General Information** (spews out all data available from `queryDev` command)
- `detailed` - **Detailed Information** (spews out all data available from `queryData` command)
- `voltage` - **Voltage** (voltage for every available phase, also mean voltage)
- `current` - **Current** (current for every available phase, also mean current)
- `power_factor` - **Power Factor**
- `active_power` - **Active Power**
- `reactive_power` - **Reactive Power**

Recent release added support for switches, but so far there is only one supported:
- `main_power` - **Main Power** (toggles relay power on and off) 

#### Custom sensors, set polling interval and name
```yaml
hekr:
  devices:
    - device_id: ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF
      host: home-power-meter.lan
      control_key: 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70
      scan_interval:
        seconds: 15
      protocol: power_meter
      sensors:
        - general
        - detailed
        - status
        - current_consumption
        - total_consumption
        - voltage
        - current
        - power_factor
        - active_power
        - reactive_power
```

#### Enable `main_power` switch, do not add any sensors
```yaml
hekr:
  devices:
    - device_id: ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF
      host: home-power-meter.lan
      control_key: 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70
      scan_interval:
        seconds: 15
      protocol: power_meter
      sensors: false
      switches:
        - main_power
```

## Power socket protocol: `power_socket`
<a name="power_socket_protocol">

<!--_(more screenshots available at: [images/power_socket](images/power_socket))_-->

### Supported devices
- SK-B-03/16A/EU
- 7h sevenON elec
- Sockets that identify themselves as CZ-05

### Example configuration
```yaml
hekr:
  devices:
    - host: tv-power-socket.lan
      device_id: ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF
      control_key: 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70
      protocol: power_socket
```

In this state, the component will generate a single switch (`main_power`) obtained via a
single `Quary` command.

<!-- Unfortunately, they named it Quary, not Query, and I'm equally irked by this -->

## Fetching `device_id` and `control_key` for local setup
The following steps (evidently) assume you already paired target device using Wisen.

### _Integrations_ menu
The easiest way to accomplish this is to begin an integration flow with `account` setup type.

Tick the box `Create notification with device info` during setup, and a persistent notification
will appear containing compatible YAML config.

### _Wisen_ application   (Only Android ! Doesn't work with Apple App anymore)
To obtain `device_id` and `control_key`:
- Open _Wisen_ application
- Open sidebar menu (on the left)
- Select _Management_ menu entry
- Select your device
- Tap device icon at the top 5 times
- A toast notification will appear

### HttpCanary (packet sniffing, Android)
The following tutorial is left for educational purposes / explanation on how protocol decoding was done.

##### Pre-requisites:
- An android device with working Wi-Fi
- Installed _HttpCanary_ application ([Google Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guoshi.httpcanary&hl=ru))
- Installed and configured _Wisen_ application ([Google Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.hekr.hummingbird))
- Configured target device via Wisen application
- Non-isolated access point to communicate with target device

##### Capturing instructions:
1. Open _HttpCanary_ application, and do the following:
   1. ___(required)___ Accept VPN configuration and ___(optional)___ install root certificate
   1. Open `Target Apps` from the side menu
   1. Tap `+` in the top right corner
   1. Search for `Wisen` in the search box, and select _Wisen_ from search results 
   1. Go back to the main screen; you will see _Wisen_'s icon with `Tap the floating button to start capture` text under
      it appear in the middle of your screen. __!!! DO NOT START CAPTURE YET !!!__
1. Force-close and re-open _Wisen_ application, and do the following:
   1. Open `Settings` from the side menu
   1. Open `LAN settings` submenu
   1. Flick the switch to ___on___ position
1. Go back to the _HttpCanary_ application, and start listening by pressing button in the bottom left corner; you will
   now observe `Capturing...` as well as possibly some of cloud Wisen's requests appear on screen; should they not
   appear, go back to _Wisen_ and open up your device from the grid of available devices. After than, enough requests
   will be made to successfully extract needed data.
1. Look for requests with of `WebSocket` type, or `UDP` type to port `10000`. Once you found at least one, open it and
   look for messages containing `ctrlKey` (=`control_key`) and `devTid` (=`device_id`).
   An example response would look something like this, mind the linebreaks:
   ```js
   {
     "msgId": 7,
     "action": "devSend",
     "params": {
       "devTid": "ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF", // This will be your `device_id`
       "appTid": [],
       "subDevTid": null,
       "ctrlKey": "202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70", // This will be your `control_key`
       // more data...
     },
     // more data...
   }
   ```
1. __Congratulations, you're ready!__ You can proceed by using any of the configuration methods described above to add
   your device to HomeAssistant.
